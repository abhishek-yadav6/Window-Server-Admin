## Additional Notes

- **Organizational Units**: Creating OUs can help you manage users by grouping them logically, which is useful for setting group policies.
- **Security**: Regularly review user permissions and follow best practices for password policies.

## Additional Notes

- **User Groups**: Adding users to specific groups determines their access permissions. Ensure you understand the purpose of each group and grant the user the appropriate access level.
- **Active Directory**: If you’re managing multiple users across a domain, Active Directory simplifies user management and centralizes control over user access.
